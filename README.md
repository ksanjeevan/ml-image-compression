# ML Image Compression



### Steps

- [x] Learn about traditional image compression (e.g. JPEG)
- [ ] More sofisticated image compression
- [ ] Review of ML compression
- [ ] Study of an end to end ML compression model
- [ ] Implementation



Going to try to implement [An End-to-End Compression Framework Based on Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00838v1.pdf) 



super interesting [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Li_Learning_Convolutional_Networks_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)


gans for compression [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09965.pdf)

[this paper] on spatially adaptive bit rate
